# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations

## Project 3 - Generate TV Scripts

This is the third project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
In this project we have to train a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to generate TV scripts from the Simpsons TV show.

## Dependencies

* numpy
* jupyter notebook
* tensorflow 1.0

Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and/or [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Tensorflow can be installed via this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal to see the code.
